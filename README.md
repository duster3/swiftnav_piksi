# swiftnav_piksi
Source code for the ROS driver for the Swiftnav Pksi RTK GPS receivers

This ROS driver has been tested with the Piksi Multi GNSS Module, and the driver relies on the Swift Binary Protocol library which can be obtained [here](https://github.com/swift-nav/libsbp). Note that testing was performed with v2.1.7. The installation instructions can be found [here](https://swift-nav.github.io/libsbp/c/build/docs/html/install.html).
